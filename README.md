# c_single_file

This is a little collection of C files I've written to learn different features and computer architecture.

- `filter_function_any_type.c` - This file implements a generic filter function in C that works with any data type using `void*` and manual memory management. Its like functional programming!!
- `array with multiple data types using enum and unions.c` - this implements an array with multiple types of data using unions - I wrote this when I first learned about unions
- `fibonacci_timing.c` - I took a computer class for fun and there was an assignment to do a fibonacci sequence. Apparently we were supposed to do it in python so I turned this one into a thing to time different approaches
- `pointer arithmetic.c` - some basic pointer arithmetic
- `struct stuff.c` - messing around with structs
- `unions - int and char[] sharing memory - endian stuff.c` - I learnt about unions so I started using them to mess around with 4 byte ints, and 4 byte char*s.
- I have also made a few mini games like snake a pong using SDL

### do this
- `gcc -o main.exe {file} && ./main.exe && rm main.exe `
- I have MSYS and WSL configured strangely so who knows if it'll run on your machine
